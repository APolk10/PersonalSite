            My name is Adam and as the headline says I am a former elementary music educator who is going on a new adventure. I started my coding journey in September of 2021 when a friend and I reconnected and he talked my ear off about his new software job. I had never really thought about a life in tech before that, but from the way he spoke of it I began to get an odd feeling in the pit of my stomach. See, the truth was I had been wondering what was next in my life for a few years now. I love music, and I love education, but I also knew that it was time for a change. From there, I decided to act on that feeling and bought a book about Python. I loved it from the very start. I remember wrestling through setting up my environment for the first time and the first print ('Hello World') and what started as a dip my toes into the pool of software turned into a complete life change as I found myself applying to Hack Reactor by the end of that school year. I had to deep dive into JavaScript to prepare but I was lucky enough to get in and, well, here I am now! Looking to learn and grow in this new and exciting field where I get to build cool things and help improve the world I live in. If you want to know more or just to chat, reach out to me on LinkedIn! I'd love to talk.
