              My name is Adam and I'm a former elementary music educator going on a new adventure. I started my coding journey in 2021 when a friend and I reconnected and he was raving about his new software job. Before that, I had never really thought about the tech field. However, from the way he spoke of it, I began to get an odd feeling in the pit of my stomach.

              See, the truth was I had been wondering what was next in my life for a few years now. I love music, and I love education, but I also knew that it was time for a change. I decided to act on that feeling and bought a book about Python.
            <u>I loved it from the very start.</u>
              I remember wrestling through setting up my environment for the first time and the first print ('Hello World') and what started as a "dip my toes into the pool of software" turned into a complete life change.

               By the end of that school year I decided to attend Hack Reactor and so I quickly immersed myself in JavaScript. It was tough to prepare, but I was lucky enough to get in and, well, here I am now! Looking to learn and grow in this new and exciting field where I get to build cool things and help improve the world I live in. If you want to know more or just to chat, reach out to me on LinkedIn! I'd love to talk.
